# Description
This project efficiently extracts material data from Old Navy clothing items through web crawlers and provides an Eco-friendliness score given an Old Navy clothing item URL. Created frontend with ReactJS, implementing action events such as state changes and routers. The server was deployed on AWS EC3 using Node.js, and database records for clothing material were created in MongoDB.

# What I Learned
- Utilized AWS S3 for static site hosting and connected to an EC2 server for web scraping requests.
- Learned React.js hooks, router, and component-based architecture.
- Web crawling techniques through HTML document parsing with the Cheerio library and CSS selectors.
- MongoDB data storage and connecting it to the EC2 server.
